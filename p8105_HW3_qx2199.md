## Problem 1

\#\#Load the Instacart data.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The Instacart dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – product ID, product name, aisle, department,
and some numeric codes.

\#\#How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

As we can see, there are 134 aisles, and " fresh vegetables "are which
the most items from.

\#\#Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize the plot.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_HW3_qx2199_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

The top 2 aisles are “fresh vegetables” and “fresh fruits”.

\#\#Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in the table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

\*The top 3 items in baking ingredients aisle are “Light Brown Sugar”,
“Pure Baking Soda”, and “Cane Sugar”.

\*The top 3 items in dog food care aisle are “Snack Sticks Chicken &
Rice Recipe Dog Treats”, “Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe”, and
“Small Dog Biscuits”.

\*The top 3 items in packaged vegetables fruits aisle are “Organic Baby
Spinach”, “Organic Raspberries”, and “Organic Blueberries”.

\#\#Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
the table as a 2 x 7 table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

\#\#Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the accelerometers data

``` r
accel_df = read.csv('./accel_data.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_counts"
  ) %>% 
mutate(day = factor (day, levels = c ("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")))%>%

  mutate(day_type = case_when(
      day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "weekday",
      day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")~ "weekend")) %>%

  mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute)) %>%
arrange(week,day)
```

\#\#data discription: The tidy accelerometers dataset include 6
variables and 50400 rows.The variable names are ‘week’,
‘day’,‘minute’,‘activity counts’ ‘day id’ and ‘day type’.

\#\#Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a
total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these
totals.

``` r
accel_df_new = accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarise(total_activity_per_day = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  arrange(week, day) %>% 
pivot_wider(
  names_from = day,
  values_from = total_activity_per_day
)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

\*The person tends to be less active on the Saturday in week 4 and week
5. Alos, the person tends to have a relative stable activity exercise
during the weendays but a relatevely higher activity exercise on
Fridays.

\#\#Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.
